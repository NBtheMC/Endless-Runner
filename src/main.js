Game Title: 
    Nell's Wizard Adventure
Date Completed: 
    May 3rd, 2021
Creative Tilt Justification:
    For our technical side, we're particularly proud of our implementation of particles and transitions.
    Naman researched the particle emitter using the phaser documentation to add some polish visual feedback. 
    Although not an artist, he also made the particles that fit the theme.
    Paul tested out different object velocities & timings to make the transitions cohesive and as seamless as possible. 
    This was done with addEvents with delays to patch bugs that occurred when dying in the middle of a transition with setTimeout().

    For our art side, we're particularly proud of our original music and art.
    Miriam...
    Emil created original visual concepts for the background, character, and obstacles to ensure that there was a visual direction and
        that the group enjoyed what the game was going to look like. He also created the final assets for those, drawing the
        frame-by-frame animation for the main character.
